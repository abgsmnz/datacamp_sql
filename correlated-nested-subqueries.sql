/*Correlated subquery with multiple conditions
Correlated subqueries are useful for matching data across multiple columns. 
In the previous exercise, you generated a list of matches with extremely high scores for each country. 
In this exercise, you're going to add an additional column for matching to answer the question 
-- what was the highest scoring match for each country, in each season?
*Note: this query may take a while to load.*/

SELECT 
	-- Select country ID, date, home, and away goals from match
	main.country_id,
    main.date,
    main.home_goal, 
    main.away_goal
FROM match AS main
WHERE 
	-- Filter the main query by the subquery
	(home_goal + away_goal) > 
        (SELECT AVG((sub.home_goal + sub.away_goal) * 3)
         FROM match AS sub
         -- Join the main query to the subquery in WHERE
         WHERE main.country_id = sub.country_id);
         
SELECT 
	-- Select country ID, date, home, and away goals from match
	main.country_id,
    main.date,
    main.home_goal,
    main.away_goal
FROM match AS main
WHERE 
	-- Filter for matches with the highest number of goals scored
	(home_goal + away_goal) = 
        (SELECT MAX(sub.home_goal + sub.away_goal)
         FROM match AS sub
         WHERE main.country_id = sub.country_id
               AND main.season = sub.season);
               
-- Nested Subqueries
/*Nested simple subqueries
Nested subqueries can be either simple or correlated.
Just like an unnested subquery, a nested subquery's components can be executed independently of the outer query, 
while a correlated subquery requires both the outer and inner subquery to run and produce results*/
SELECT
	-- Select the season and max goals scored in a match
	season,
    MAX(home_goal + away_goal) AS max_goals,
    -- Select the overall max goals scored in a match
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal) FROM match) AS overall_max_goals,
   -- Select the max number of goals scored in any match in July
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal) 
    FROM match
    WHERE id IN (
          SELECT id FROM match WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = 07)) AS july_max_goals
